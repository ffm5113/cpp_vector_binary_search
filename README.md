# cpp_vector_binary_search
The Vector Binary Search Program (C++) creates and fills a vector with 5000 random integers. Once the vector is filled, the program displays details such as the smallest, largest, and average values. To conclude, the program asks the user to enter an integer. If the integer is found via binary search, the program returns its position.
